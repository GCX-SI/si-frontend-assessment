    Most of your audience will consist of developers. Therefore, you should create your presentation in a way you would
    expect from a developer in this position yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good presentation should introduce yourself and your background <span>(1-3 minutes)</span>, your considerations
    and approach to your solution <span>(0-6 minutes)</span>, your runnable implementation
    <span>(2-5 minutes)</span> and finally you present us the source code to your solution and we will end with a Q&A
    <span>(5-15 minutes)</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall you have 20 minutes for your presentation. Please don't present the assignment to our developers, we know it
    well.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have all common tools for presentations to your proposal: a 16:10-beamer (1900x1200, HDMI, MiniDP, USB-C),
    whiteboard and flipchart. If you have special requirements, please inform us in advance.
  </p>
  <p>
    General rule: If you have questions about the challenge or the organisation of your assessment don't hesitate to ask
    us.
  </p>

    After the Q&A our team will discuss your presentation. We do not rate your solution in terms of right or wrong, but
    on the basis of objective criteria. It is not important to finish the task, priotizing is part of this challenge. We
    want you to utilise Vue.js. Apart from that, there are no limitations regarding the used technologies, frameworks or
    libraries. Please bear in mind that an exotic choice might be harder to evaluate for us. We recommend vite, axios,
    vuex and primevue

    The imaginary IoT-Hub represents a management tool for smart devices produced by a customer. Each device entity is
    connected to a real device. There are different users which can have multiple devices claimed. The application is
    protected by authentication. Only claimed devices are shown. Sensors and other device data can be inspected on a
    detail view updating themselves. Unclaiming a device removes it from all views.
  </p>
  <p>
    Create a concept for the software and implement a first prototype. Important non-functional requirements are user
    experience, maintainability, testability, extensibility and security. Point out how you would fulfil those criteria
    and how you can measure the quality of the released software. Additionally, define your vision of a Definition of
    Done and then consider whether your software meets it. You should not spend much more than
    <strong>4 hours</strong> for the solution of this task and the preparation of your presentation. Please spend most
    of the time on software development, we want to see code!
